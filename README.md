# DataViewer
Json data viewer

This project's intention is to show my ability to write modern desktop application that utilises new languge and framework features.

- scan for data inconsistency and document healing
- export to excel
- text translation via Google Translation Cloud
- modern language features (C# 8) and useful design patterns
- clean and consistent code
- MVVM and dependency injection by using Caliburn Micro
- Undo/Redo functionality that is isolated from the rest of the code

Example documents to play around with are in the repository itself.
